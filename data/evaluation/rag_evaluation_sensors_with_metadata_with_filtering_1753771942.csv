1. **Comparator Mode**: In this mode, the ALERT pin is used to signal when the temperature exceeds or falls below a predefined threshold. The pin will change its state (active low or high) based on the programmed over/under temperature settings. This mode is typically used for continuous monitoring, where the system can take action based on the temperature readings without needing to interrupt the main processing flow.

When the temperature crosses the set thresholds, the ALERT pin generates an interrupt, allowing the MCU to pause its current tasks and handle the temperature event. This mode is useful for power-sensitive applications, as it allows the MCU to remain in a low-power state until an important temperature event occurs.

In summary, Comparator Mode continuously monitors temperature and signals changes, while Interrupt Mode generates an interrupt to alert the MCU when temperature thresholds are crossed, allowing for more efficient power management.","In Comparator Mode, the PJ85775's ALERT pin follows the temperature relative to high/low limits, while in Interrupt Mode it latches until cleared by a read command.",7.744452953338623,2,multi_sensor_filtered,PJ85775,True,0.0,0.909,0.0,0.0

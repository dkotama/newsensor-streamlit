When the temperature exceeds or falls below the programmed thresholds, the sensor can queue up to a certain number of fault conditions (typically configurable). The sensor will only assert the ALERT pin after a specified number of consecutive fault conditions have been detected, thus ensuring that only persistent temperature changes trigger an alert. This feature is particularly useful in applications where brief temperature spikes or dips may occur but do not represent a true fault condition.

The specifics of how many faults can be queued and the exact configuration options would typically be detailed in the device's datasheet or technical documentation.","The PJ85775's 'Fault Queue' requires a set number of consecutive temperature faults (1, 2, 4, or 6) before triggering an alert.",5.286895036697388,5,0.0,0.991,0.0,0.0
35,What is the difference between Comparator Mode and Interrupt Mode for the PJ85775's ALERT pin?,"The PJ85775's ALERT pin can operate in two modes: Comparator Mode and Interrupt Mode. 

1. **Comparator Mode**: In this mode, the ALERT pin is used to signal when the temperature exceeds or falls below the programmed over/under temperature thresholds. The pin will change its state (active low or high) based on the temperature readings compared to the set thresholds. This mode continuously monitors the temperature and provides a real-time indication of whether the temperature is within the acceptable range.

2. **Interrupt Mode**: In this mode, the ALERT pin functions as an interrupt signal. It is triggered only when the temperature crosses the set thresholds, generating a one-time alert. This mode is useful for applications where the microcontroller or processor can enter a low-power state and only wake up when an alert is generated, thus conserving energy.

In summary, Comparator Mode provides continuous monitoring and alerts based on temperature changes, while Interrupt Mode generates alerts only when specific temperature thresholds are crossed, allowing for more efficient power management.","In Comparator Mode, the PJ85775's ALERT pin follows the temperature relative to high/low limits, while in Interrupt Mode it latches until cleared by a read command.",7.157962083816528,5,0.0,0.909,0.0,0.0
